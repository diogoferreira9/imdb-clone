# üé¨ IMDB Clone

IMDB Clone is a Java-based command-line application that parses, indexes, and queries movie data from multiple CSV files. It simulates a lightweight IMDb-like system with functionality for analyzing actors, directors, genres, and films using custom commands.

## üìÅ Project Structure

The project follows a modular design with clear separation between data parsing, object modeling, and query execution.

### Main Components

| Class         | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `Main`        | Entry point, file parser, command interpreter. |
| `Queries`     | Contains logic for all supported user commands. |
| `Filme`       | Represents a movie and its associated data. |
| `Ator`        | Represents an actor linked to a movie. |
| `Realizador`  | Represents a director and their movies. |
| `Genero`      | Represents a genre. |
| `InputInvalido` | Tracks invalid rows during file parsing. |
| `Result`      | Wraps command results with success/error state. |
| `TipoEntidade`| Enum for data categories (FILME, ATOR, etc.). |

## üöÄ Getting Started

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites

- Java 11 or higher
- IDE or terminal access for running Java programs

### üìÇ Data Files

Place your CSV files inside a folder named `test-files/TestMain`, with the following expected filenames:

- `actors.csv`
- `directors.csv`
- `genres.csv`
- `genres_movies.csv`
- `movie_votes.csv`

Each file is parsed once at startup.
